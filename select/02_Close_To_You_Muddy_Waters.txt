I wanna be close to you, baby, as I can get
Close to you, baby, as water is wet
Close to you, baby, as hair on your head
Close to you, babe, you better believe what I said
I wanna be close to you, baby
Yeah, let me be close to you
I wanna be close to you, darlin'
Till you don't know what to say or do

I wanna be close to you, baby, as white is to rice
Close to you, baby, as cold is to ice
Close to you, baby, as fire is to smoke
Close to you, baby, as a pig is to poke

I wanna be close to you, baby
Let me be close to you
I wanna be close to you, darlin'
Till you don't know what to say or do

I said, closer and closer, babe
Closer and closer, baby
Closer and closer, baby
Closer and closer, baby

I wanna to be close to you, darlin'
Till you don't know what to say or do, yeah

I wanna be close to you, baby, as the whites of your eyes
Close to you, baby, as cold is to ice
Close to you, baby, as a egg is to a hen
Close to you, baby, as Siamese twins

I wanna be close to you, baby
Let me be close to you
I want to be close to you, darlin'
Till you don't know what to say or do
