Verse 1
You don't need to waste your time searching
You've been waiting for a girl like me

I'm the one who's gonna ease your yearning
There's no doubt about it – it's me

Bridge 1
Better stop this waste of time
You'll be mine
I'm the only one for you

Refrain
You don't need to run
You don't need to hide
You can't escape my desire

So why hesitate?
You're mine anyway
Surrender - you know, I will be

Close to you
I belong
Close to you
And I belong even close than closer

Verse 2
You should really get to know me better
You will never find a girl like me

We are meant to spend this life together
Might sound crazy but you'll see

Bridge 2
I will creep into your dreams
When you sleep
And I'm gonna let you know

Refrain
You don't need to run
You don't need to hide
You can't escape my desire

So why hesitate?
You're mine anyway
Surrender – my heart's on fire

Close to you
I belong
Close to you
I long to be close to you
